*  Xyce Memristor technology .MODEL. 
*
*  Basic AC Sinusoidal 1V pk supply.
*
*  A copy of this model must be placed on 
*  (a) a Xyce top level circuit schematic with Knowm memristor components only, 
*  or on 
*  (b) a Xyce user defined subckt which contains Knowm memristor components only.
* 
*  See the the Qucs-S Help documentation for more information on how to construct and simulate Xyce schematics with
*  linear components and logic components built with different technologies.
*
*  Note the Xyce "memristor" technology model name for Knowm memristor components is MRM5. This is the same for all 
*  types of Qucs-S Xyce memristor technologies and must NOT be changed.
